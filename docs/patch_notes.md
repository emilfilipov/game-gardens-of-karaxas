- Added publish-drain orchestration and audit schema for content/release activation, with non-admin session draining and forced logout cutoffs.
- Added launcher realtime event-stream handling for publish warnings/forced logout and automatic return to auth after state-save.
- Added rollout hardening controls and observability APIs (`/ops/release/feature-flags`, `/ops/release/metrics`, `/ops/release/admin-audit`).
- Added signed content-contract compatibility flow (`content_contract_signature` + `X-Client-Content-Contract`) with backend mismatch enforcement.
- Added security hardening: request-ID/sanitized errors, secure headers/CORS/body limits, auth/chat rate limiting, and one-time websocket tickets.
- Added Secret Manager-ready deploy support (`*_SECRET_REF`) and CI vulnerability gates (`pip-audit` + Trivy workflow).
- Added operational and security runbooks (`docs/OPERATIONS.md`, `docs/SECURITY.md`) plus stress-probe tooling for publish-drain validation.
