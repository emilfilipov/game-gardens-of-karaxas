- Forced launcher startup into borderless fullscreen using display-device fullscreen/bounds fallback on Linux.
- Disabled startup auto-login entirely so launcher always opens on the auth screen for manual login.
- Kept cog menu interaction path single-bound so the top-right menu opens reliably after login.
