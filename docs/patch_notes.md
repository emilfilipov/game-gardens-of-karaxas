- Converted Create Character skill slots to fixed square buttons while preserving six slots per row.
- Added a standardized themed skill tooltip template with sections for full name, mana/energy/life costs, effects, damage/cooldown, type tag, and description.
- Filled current starter skill tooltips with placeholder values so the tooltip UI can be visually validated in-game.
