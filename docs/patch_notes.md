- Added backend deploy workflow auth fallback so GitHub Actions can authenticate with `GCP_SA_KEY_JSON` (service-account key) when WIF is not configured.
- Hardened backend deploy flow with `SKIP_BOOTSTRAP=1` support to avoid requiring high-privilege project bootstrap operations in CI.
- Updated launcher release trigger filters so editing `deploy-backend.yml` does not trigger a launcher release.
