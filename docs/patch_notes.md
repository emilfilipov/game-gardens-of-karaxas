- Added 8-direction sprite runtime scaffolding: launcher now auto-detects 4-dir/8-dir walk-run sheets and uses 8-way facing when available with 4-way fallback.
- Added modular equipment data foundations: new validated content payload sections (`equipment_slots`, `equipment_visuals`) and persisted character equipment loadouts.
- Added blocked input ticket for art production requirements (style refs, resolution/zoom, slot list, v1 item list, and frame-count contract) so remaining art-heavy implementation can proceed deterministically.
