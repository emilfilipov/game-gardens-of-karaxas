- Expanded MFA from admin-only to all authenticated users with user-facing API routes (`/auth/mfa/status`, `/auth/mfa/setup`, `/auth/mfa/enable`, `/auth/mfa/disable`) and backward-compatible admin aliases.
- Login now supports optional MFA OTP submission (`otp_code`) and enforces MFA for any account that has MFA enabled.
- Replaced placeholder settings popup with a full in-launcher Settings screen (Video/Audio/Security sidebar tabs + central panel) available after login.
- Added save/cancel confirmation flows for settings changes, immediate screen-mode apply (`Borderless Fullscreen`/`Windowed`), persisted audio preferences, and in-settings MFA management UI.
