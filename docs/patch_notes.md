- Forced launcher startup default to borderless fullscreen to prevent persisted windowed-size lock-in.
- Fixed cog menu dead-click state by removing auth-guard early return from the click handler.
- Disabled startup auto-login by default (requires `GOK_ENABLE_STARTUP_AUTO_LOGIN=true`) so launcher consistently opens on auth screen.
