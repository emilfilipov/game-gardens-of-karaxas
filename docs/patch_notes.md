- Expanded admin `Level Editor` and `Asset Editor` panels to use larger near-full-height layouts for more vertical workspace.
- Refactored `Level Editor` to staged-change workflow with `Save Local` and `Publish Changes`, plus persistent local queue (`level_editor_local_draft.json`) and right-side pending-drafts panel.
- Added `Level Editor` reload flow that restores staged drafts on entry/reload and keeps level list refresh synced with local pending state.
