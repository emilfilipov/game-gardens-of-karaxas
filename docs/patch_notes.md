- Hardened GCS release publishing to mark mutable feed files (`RELEASES`, setup exe, portable zip, manifests) as `Cache-Control: no-cache, max-age=0`.
- Prevents stale installer/feed caching from serving outdated launcher builds after a new release is published.
- Fixed startup window-mode crash (`IllegalComponentStateException`) that could skip auth-screen routing and leave the default create-character card visible.
- Added MFA setup QR dialog in Security settings (scan-ready code + copy secret/URI buttons) so authenticator apps can be enrolled without manual URI typing.
