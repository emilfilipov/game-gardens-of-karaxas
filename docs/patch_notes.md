- Moved chat and guild views out of the account lobby and into the in-game social screen, gated behind active character selection.
- Enforced character selection on backend chat APIs and websocket chat access (`character_required` flow) so social features are only available in character session context.
- Refined account lobby into account-only functionality (auth/account status, character summary, navigation, updater access).
- Upgraded character creation UI structure with appearance selector + preview scaffold that auto-discovers art files from `assets/characters/` (or `GOK_CHARACTER_ART_DIR`).
- Improved character selection UI with structured details panel and active-character status feedback.
