- Added persistent character location storage (`level_id` + `location_x/location_y`) with backend migration and API support, then wired launcher resume so characters continue from last saved coordinates.
- Character List rows/details now show `Location` (area + coordinates when known) instead of map-only text.
- Added live-editable level-editor grid size controls (width/height + apply) with validation, immediate canvas resize, and bounds clamping.
- Kept level-related controls on the shared themed dropdown class and hardened character art discovery/resolution so previews render across create/select/game/editor flows.
