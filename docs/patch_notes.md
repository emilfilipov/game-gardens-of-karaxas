- Removed the separate Lobby screen and merged authenticated navigation to `Create` and `Select` tabs only.
- Centered login/register form fields and controls in the auth card.
- Removed the `Login to continue` message from autoplay fallback behavior.
- Made the top-right cog button render as a square themed control.
- Updated post-login UI surfaces to solid opaque colors to prevent transparent bleed-through and stacked-menu ghosting artifacts.
- Enforced fixed-height character cards with horizontal-scroll suppression so rows fit the selection list viewport.
- Updated create/select back-navigation labels and routes to match the new Create/Select-only flow.
