- Validated and integrated new character sprites: both male/female idle sprites (`32x32`) and walk/run sheets (`192x128`, 4 directions x 6 frames).
- Moved new character art assets into `assets/characters/` and wired launcher discovery so they are loaded automatically.
- Added animated character preview controls in character creation (Idle/Walk/Run) using the supplied sprite sheets.
- Enhanced character selection with appearance-aware details and visual preview.
- Persisted character visual preset selection in backend (`appearance_key` on `characters`) and added migration `0002_character_appearance_key`.
- Updated launcher/backend character API wiring so create/list/select flow now carries appearance keys end-to-end.
