- Redesigned launcher UI controls to use shape-based themed rendering (thin borders + painted fills) instead of PNG-based button/panel skins.
- Kept the same full-screen background image for the main visual theme while replacing interactive chrome.
- Updated form fields to consistent bordered inputs for clearer structure and alignment stability.
- Reworked major container frames to painted gradient panels, reducing visual artifacts from textured frame overlays.
- Preserved existing account/auth/character/game flow behavior while applying the new styling system.
