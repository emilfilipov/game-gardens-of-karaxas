- Added playable combat runtime in world view with `basic attack`, `Ember`, `Cleave`, `Quick Strike`, and `Bandage`, including cooldown/resource tracking and HUD state updates.
- Added enemy prototype system with config-driven spawn catalog, chase/attack AI, death handling, quest kill events, and loot drops.
- Added inventory/equipment world loop (`pickup/use/equip/drop`) with stack handling and equipment bonuses applied to combat stats.
- Added NPC interaction + quest progression v1 with acceptance flow and kill-goal updates persisted in local saves.
- Upgraded Level Editor to tool-first interaction via `level_editor_canvas.gd` (active layer, brush asset, mode, grid/collision overlays) while retaining optional advanced JSON editing.
- Upgraded Asset Editor to structured searchable forms (key/label/layer/collision/description) with inline validation and unique-key guards.
- Expanded settings with keybinding capture, gamepad toggle/deadzone controls, UI scale, high-contrast toggle, and runtime keybind propagation.
- Hardened save/config IO with atomic writes, timestamped backups, automatic backup recovery, and a load-screen restore action.
- Added explicit config schema at `game-client/assets/config/schema/game_config.schema.json` and generated field reference docs in `docs/CONFIG_FIELDS.md`.
- Added release-notes visibility in both main menu and world UI for player-facing change summaries.
- Updated UI regression harness signature/sources for the new world + editor architecture.
- Updated task tracking so GOK-SPRPG-023 through GOK-SPRPG-034 are recorded as completed and backlog now starts at GOK-SPRPG-035.
