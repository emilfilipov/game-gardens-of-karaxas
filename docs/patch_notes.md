- Removed GitHub-release transition logic from release automation; publishing is now GCS-only.
- Removed GitHub release-note rendering/publish templates and scripts from the repository.
- Removed updater token plumbing from launcher client and update-helper so client update flow no longer carries GitHub token/repository hooks.
- Updated release-activation audit actor label from `github-actions` to generic `release-pipeline`.
