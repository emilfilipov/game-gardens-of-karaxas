- Unified launcher text styling to one shared theme font/color across buttons, labels, and update menu text.
- Updated register mode actions to `Register` and `Back` (replacing `Use Login`).
- Styled update progress bars for both download and apply/check phases with the same brown in-game theme.
- Added themed update status text rendering directly in the update card for clearer process visibility.
- Normalized patch-notes/log HTML rendering to the same launcher text font/color token.
- Fixed top-right cog menu control to render as a true square by constraining it in a non-stretching wrapper.
