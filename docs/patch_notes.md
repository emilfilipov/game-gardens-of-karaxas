- Added admin-only level builder support end-to-end: new backend `levels` APIs/models/migration plus launcher level-editor UI with spawn and wall placement, save/load by level name, and map list refresh wiring.
- Added per-character map assignment controls (admin-only dropdown on character cards) and gameplay handoff that loads assigned level layout/spawn into the world scene.
- Added tile-based wall collision from loaded level data on top of world-edge collision for the empty-world prototype.
- Replaced hardcoded `admin@admin.com` checks with a database-backed `users.is_admin` flag, a shared backend admin dependency, and auth session propagation (`is_admin`) to the launcher.
- Character preview/details in Character List now update only when the character card row itself is clicked; row action buttons no longer drive preview selection state.
