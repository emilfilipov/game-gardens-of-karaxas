- Expanded the pre-login auth screen into a split layout with authentication form on the left and compact updater/release-notes panel on the right.
- Added direct `Update & Restart` action to the auth screen, including status text and embedded release-notes preview.
- Hid the cogwheel menu on the auth screen while keeping it available for logged-in flows.
- Kept updater behavior status-text-based (`Game is up to date` when no update is found) with automatic restart on successful auth-screen updates.
