- Fixed Create Character preview scale consistency so initial male render and post-switch renders use the same zoom.
- Reworked stats into fixed-size left control cards plus right description cards, with square `- / +` buttons and expanded placeholder stat coverage.
- Resized skill buttons into a fixed six-slots-per-row layout for cleaner, predictable spacing.
- Restored a live `x/10 points left` indicator beside the `Create Character` button.
