- Moved `Race`, `Background`, and `Affiliation` out of the skills box and into the same horizontal identity row as `Name` and `Sex` on the Create Character screen.
- Locked Create Character stats/skills tables and row controls to fixed sizes to prevent UI stretching and drift.
- Fixed level-editor scene overflow by reducing grid canvas minimum size and splitting the compact top control strip into two rows so it fits on-screen.
