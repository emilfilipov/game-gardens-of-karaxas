- Fixed character art preview discovery when launching from subdirectories (for example `repo/launcher`) by probing ancestor asset roots in addition to payload/install paths.
- Fixed sex preset switching so selecting `Male` no longer resolves to female art due to substring collisions.
- Updated character preview rendering to preserve sprite aspect ratio with nearest-neighbor scaling, preventing stretched male/female previews.
