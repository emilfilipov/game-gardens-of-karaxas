- Fixed backend startup stability for Cloud Run by correcting observability metrics-state initialization (`deque` default now uses `default_factory`).
- Replaced backend JWT implementation dependency from `python-jose` to `PyJWT`, removing the vulnerable `ecdsa` transitive path flagged by `pip-audit`.
- Hardened backend container runtime to run as a dedicated non-root user, satisfying Trivy Dockerfile security baseline checks.
