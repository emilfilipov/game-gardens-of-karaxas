- Reworked Security MFA controls into a compact toggle flow (`MFA: ON/OFF`) with authenticator code input aligned in the same row.
- Removed split enable/disable/refresh controls and applied a single OTP-confirmed toggle action for both states.
- Revamped MFA QR enrollment window with full game-theme styling and simplified content (QR-first layout + copy secret/URI + close, no large text box).
