- Completed Epic A test closure with launcher golden fixtures for layered level payload serialization/deserialization and legacy wall fallback parsing.
- Implemented Epic B data-driven content baseline:
  - added backend content version/bundle schema + migration (`0009_content_model`),
  - added content bootstrap/admin version APIs and snapshot cache/validation pipeline,
  - moved character creation/progression constraints to content-driven values.
- Wired launcher to content bootstrap with cache fallback:
  - startup fetch from backend + local `content_bootstrap_cache.json`,
  - content-driven create-screen options/tooltips/budget/stat caps and movement tuning,
  - gameplay/create gating when no valid content snapshot exists.
- Added deterministic backend content/combat tests and launcher codec tests to protect the new content/layer contracts.
