- Added build+content release gating on backend auth/session paths, including non-admin `426` lockout after grace and admin exemption.
- Added DB-backed release history (`release_records`) and public `GET /release/summary` endpoint for launcher-consumable feed metadata and release notes.
- Extended release activation payloads to include GCS feed URL and both technical/user-facing release notes, and broadcasted content-aware force-update events.
- Added content-version tracking to user sessions and launcher auth requests via `X-Client-Content-Version` plus login/refresh payload fields.
- Switched launcher updater helper integration to generic Velopack feed URLs and wired auth-screen release notes/feed hydration from backend release summary.
- Migrated release workflow to publish Velopack artifacts to GCS feed/archive paths, notify backend with release metadata, and keep optional one-transition GitHub release publishing.
