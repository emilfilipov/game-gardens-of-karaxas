- Removed updater progress bars from the launcher update screen and kept status-text-only feedback under patch notes.
- Updated helper apply flow to request silent Velopack update application and switched the helper build to windowless (`WinExe`) to reduce extra update pop-up windows.
- Removed preview-animation controls from character creation and kept a static idle preview tied to sex/appearance choice.
- Reordered authenticated tabs to `Character List` -> `Create Character` -> `Levels`, and changed active-tab visibility to highlighted buttons instead of dim/unreadable text.
- Removed the redundant create-screen `Back to Select` button (tab navigation remains the path between create/list screens).
- Standardized launcher dropdowns and scroll containers through reusable themed classes so surfaces no longer fall back to white/default styling.
