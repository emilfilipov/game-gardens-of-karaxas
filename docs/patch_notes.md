- Reworked launcher entry UX into a single centered authentication panel with login/register toggle and transparent placeholder fields.
- Switched launcher runtime to borderless fullscreen by default and added top-right cog dropdown with `Settings` and `Exit`.
- Added centered footer version/date label to the launcher shell.
- Updated launcher backend endpoint fallback to Cloud Run (instead of localhost) when `GOK_API_BASE_URL` is not set.
- Improved auth failure reporting to show the real backend error and log auth exceptions to launcher logs.
- Added one-click `Update & Restart` action to the top-right cog menu so updates can run directly from the login/auth flow.
- Styled the cog dropdown to match the launcher/game visual theme (palette, typography, border, and hover behavior).
- Added client-side auth input validation (email format, password length, display-name length) and richer 422 error detail rendering.
- Updated release workflow to preserve a rolling delta package history (plus latest full fallback) so updates across skipped versions can remain delta-based instead of defaulting to full client downloads.
- Fixed update card visual alignment so build version and patch notes render fully inside the brick frame, and hid visible scrollbars while keeping wheel scrolling.
- Refactored character creation to include sex choice preview, stat/skill scaffold rows, and a fixed 10-point allocation model where each increment costs 1 point.
- Wired selected-character handoff into a playable in-launcher world scene.
- Added empty-world prototype gameplay with WASD movement and hard world-edge border collision.
