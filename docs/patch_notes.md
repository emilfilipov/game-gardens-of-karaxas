- Added launcher preference persistence for account auth (`launcher_prefs.properties`) so login remembers the last successfully used email.
- Added logged-in-only settings control for automatic login, backed by refresh-token startup authentication (`/auth/refresh`).
- Automatic login now clears invalid stored refresh tokens on auth rejection (401/403) and falls back to manual login cleanly.
- Register mode now always opens with clean inputs/hint text, and returning to auth from other screens resets register fields instead of retaining stale form values.
