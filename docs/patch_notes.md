- Fixed MFA status reporting so `/auth/mfa/status` always reads the latest account MFA state from the database.
- Replaced settings `Save` and `Cancel` confirmation popups with themed in-launcher dialogs (removed system placeholder confirm windows).
- Updated MFA enrollment popup to an undecorated game-themed modal shell (custom header/close, no OS-default chrome).
