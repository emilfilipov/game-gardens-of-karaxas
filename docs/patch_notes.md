- Changed post-login routing: accounts with no characters open Character Creation by default; accounts with characters open Character Selection by default.
- Replaced lobby-only navigation buttons with persistent authenticated tabs (Lobby/Create/Select/Play + Refresh) so navigation remains visible while switching screens.
- Removed updater access from lobby navigation; updater remains accessible from the top-right dropdown (`Update & Restart`).
- Added logged-in dropdown account identity header (`Welcome [username].`) and logged-in-only dropdown logout action.
- Applied additional lobby/theme styling to combo boxes, character list panes, titled sections, and status text for visual consistency with the game palette.
- Fixed character create/select flows to immediately reload character lists and UI state, including automatic list refresh right after character creation.
