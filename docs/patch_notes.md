- Expanded `Level Editor` and `Asset Editor` panels toward near full-screen sizing so admin tools use significantly more of the available screen space.
- Reduced Asset Editor side-column widths and scaled asset-card icons/rows down to free more room for the central JSON/detail editing surface.
- Enforced MFA login challenge whenever an account has a configured MFA secret (not only when explicitly marked enabled), blocking password-only login after QR enrollment.
