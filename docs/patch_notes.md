- Added admin `Content Versions` screen in the cog menu with searchable version-history cards, active-version highlighting, `Publish` and `Revert To` actions.
- Added side-by-side version comparison mode with two searchable selectors and item-level state output for both versions, including changed-item markers.
- Refactored `Asset Editor` to use staged edits: `Save Local` stores changes in a persistent local queue and `Publish Changes` pushes staged domains to backend draft content versions.
- Added right-side pending-changes panel in `Asset Editor` so admins can batch multiple edits before publish.
- Added backend content `assets` domain validation/defaults to support data-driven asset metadata in the content model.
- Updated admin workflow text/menu polish, including `Welcome username.` formatting in the cog dropdown.
