- Fixed Create Character skill tooltip visuals by removing white-edge artifacts and applying consistent themed tooltip styling.
- Stabilized skill tooltip hover behavior with tuned tooltip timing so hover display is more reliable.
- Moved level-builder `Load`, `Save`, and `Back` actions into the top header strip and kept the editor body focused on building controls.
- Improved level-builder auth error messaging so invalid/expired tokens show a clear re-login prompt.
- Save now validates level name and syncs current grid-size inputs before persisting level data (size, spawn, walls) to the database.
