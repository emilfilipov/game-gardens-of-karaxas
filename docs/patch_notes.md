- Removed authenticated-menu `Play`/`Refresh` tab buttons; tabs are now `Lobby`, `Create`, and `Select` only.
- Removed manual `Refresh` buttons from character create/select screens and switched to automatic character-list refresh on login routing, select-screen entry, character create, and character delete.
- Moved gameplay rendering into a dedicated scene container, so entering play from a character card fully switches out of account-card UI.
- Kept gameplay entry only on character-row `Play` actions and removed menu-level play entry points.
- Converted core authenticated content surfaces (including frame panels and character list viewport) to opaque themed rendering to prevent overlap/ghosting artifacts during menu switches and delete flows.
- Standardized character list rows as fixed-size themed cards for consistent select-screen structure.
- Removed the extra separator strip from the top-right dropdown menu to better match the game theme.
