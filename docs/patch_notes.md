- Applied a unified themed button renderer to all launcher buttons to remove white/default OS-style boxes.
- Updated login/register controls to use the same dark thin-border theme as the rest of the UI.
- Styled previously unthemed controls (`+`/`-` stat buttons and top-right cog) to match the launcher visual system.
- Kept existing functionality and layout flow unchanged while normalizing button visuals.
