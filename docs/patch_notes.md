- Implemented Epic A layered-level baseline across backend and launcher:
  - schema-versioned layered level payloads with legacy wall-format adapters,
  - layer-aware validation/API responses,
  - layer-editing tools (active layer, visibility toggles, layer-scoped paint/erase),
  - deterministic layered world rendering and collision from layer-1 collidable assets.
- Added backend migration `0008_level_layers` and layered backend tests covering legacy upgrade, collision-layer validation, and collision derivation rules.
- Added generated tile art assets for layer testing (`grass`, `wall`, `tree`, `cloud`) under `assets/tiles/` and included tile assets in launcher release payload packaging.
