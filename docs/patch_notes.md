- Stabilized create/select character preview sizing by normalizing sprite frames before scaling, so sex switching no longer changes preview zoom unexpectedly.
- Updated Create Character layout: removed scaffold text, aligned Name/Sex fields in a shared top row, expanded stat allocation into two columns, and added race/background/affiliation dropdown scaffolds above skills.
- Expanded skills scaffold space with additional themed placeholder slots for future skills.
- Hardened themed combo rendering for row-level `Current Location` defaults so admin dropdowns stay on-theme instead of using platform white backgrounds.
- Enlarged the main account shell surface for more working room across authenticated menus.
- Moved admin level builder to a dedicated scene with compact controls and a virtual panning grid supporting up to `100000x100000` logical size.
- Increased backend level schema limits to support large editor dimensions and coordinates (up to `100000`).
