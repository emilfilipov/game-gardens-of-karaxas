- Added tower-floor metadata and ordering to levels (`descriptive_name`, `order_index`) plus transition-link persistence (`stairs`, `ladder`, `elevator`) in backend APIs/migration.
- Added seamless transition runtime flow: adjacent linked floors preload near transition cells and handoff occurs in-scene without loading-card interruption.
- New characters now start at first ordered floor spawn; returning characters resume from persisted floor + coordinates with first-floor fallback for missing assignment.
- Expanded admin Level Editor with descriptive name/order inputs, transition-link placement/config, and transition placeholder assets in editor/runtime rendering.
- Added admin `Level Order` scene with drag/drop floor ordering and atomic publish to backend.
- In-game cog menu is now gameplay-scoped only: `Settings`, `Logout Character`, `Logout Account`, and `Exit Game`.
