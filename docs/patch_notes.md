- Added character deletion support to backend and launcher character rows (with confirm dialog + automatic list refresh).
- Added global duplicate-character-name enforcement (case-insensitive) with backend validation and DB unique index guard.
- Added character progression scaffold fields (`level`, `experience`, `experience_to_next_level`) with defaults of level 1 / 0 XP and 100 XP-per-level progression rule.
- Refactored character selection UI to row-based actions (`Play` and `Delete`) and removed explicit `Set Active` control from the user-facing flow.
- Removed `Logged in as ...` UI label and removed skill-points counter label from character creation screen.
- Improved art loading by searching character assets in payload/install/workdir paths (plus `GOK_CHARACTER_ART_DIR`) and improved missing-art fallback rendering.
- Fixed authenticated tab view rendering by using opaque themed card surfaces to prevent visual overlap artifacts when switching tabs.
