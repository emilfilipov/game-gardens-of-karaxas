- Updated updater no-update status text to `Game is up to date.`.
- Hardened shared dropdown theming so default/current values no longer fall back to white system styling.
- Added themed scrollbar skinning to shared scroll containers, including level-maker scrollbars.
- Moved level grid size controls to the grid header area above the editor canvas (next to the Level Grid label).
- Expanded runtime character-art discovery roots and release packaging now copies `assets/characters` into payload for installed builds.
- Removed obsolete unused launcher UI PNG resources that were left over from pre-refactor image-based panel/button styling.
