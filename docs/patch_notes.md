- Consolidated security planning by moving `GOK-MMO-009` out of generic backlog into a dedicated `Epic E: Security Hardening and Trust Model` table in `docs/TASKS.md`.
- Added detailed follow-on security hardening tasks (`GOK-MMO-140` to `GOK-MMO-151`) so trust/security work is tracked in one place.
- Marked standalone backlog as empty and clarified that planned work is tracked under strategic epics.
