- Pivoted Godot runtime to a single-player shell and made it the active bootstrap entrypoint.
- Implemented local main menu flow (`New Game`, `Load Game`, `Settings`, `Update`, `Admin`, `Exit`) with no account/login dependency.
- Added local save-slot create/load/delete pipeline and world resume from slot state.
- Added central local config bootstrap (`game_config.json`) with startup/admin validation and runtime settings auto-apply.
- Added/admin-wired local designer tabs (`Level Editor`, `Asset Editor`, `Config Editor`, `Diagnostics`).
- Added runtime-configurable world movement parameters (`player_speed_tiles`, `player_radius`) from central config.
- Migrated UI regression harness to single-player shell builders/snippets and updated golden manifest targets.
- Removed obsolete backend deploy/security GitHub workflows from active pipeline.
- Removed backend release-activation callback from release workflow; release now updates GCS feed only.
- Rewrote canonical docs (`GAME`, `TECHNICAL`, `TASKS`, `README`, `INSTALLER`) for single-player architecture and operations.
