- Refactored level builder asset selection into a fixed 3-column side palette (Layer 0/1/2), with fixed-size asset cards for easier future expansion.
- Added visual asset previews and per-asset hover tooltips in the palette so tile/spawn intent is clear during level design.
- Replaced spawn visuals with a radar-ping marker placeholder in both the palette and the map canvas.
