- Reworked Character List screen structure: removed duplicated top title, moved list heading into the list container, and renamed the details panel to `Character details`.
- Reworked Create Character layout: removed `Character Art Preview` heading, split stats/skills into side-by-side tables, and anchored `Create Character` to the bottom-right of the creation area.
- Added stylized rectangular starter-skill choices (`Ember`, `Cleave`, `Quick Strike`, `Bandage`) with placeholder tooltips for stats and skills.
- Changed admin character-card level dropdown behavior to a play-time override (`Current Location` vs selected level), so choosing a level forces spawn at that level's spawn point on launch.
- Hardened themed dropdown rendering to suppress platform-default white/blue list styling artifacts.
