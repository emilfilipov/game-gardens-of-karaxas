# Gardens of Karaxas - Game

## High Concept
Gardens of Karaxas is a top-down pixel art/stylized fantasy dungeon crawler.
The game is a real-time, fast paced hack and slash where the player takes control of an adventurer and climbs the endless tower of Karaxas - one of the pilars of creation, in search for power, relics, and riches.

Karaxas is vast and mysterious. Each floor is a unique world with its own challenges, secrets, and treasures... and enemies. Those who seek to devour any uninvited guests are many, though the guests themselves seldom find peaceful resolutions to conflicts involving magical artifacts or the occassional ritual.

## Core Pillars
- Fast, readable real-time combat.
- Strong character identity and build expression.
- High replayability through floor progression and run variety.
- Atmospheric pixel/stylized fantasy presentation.
- Tight moment-to-moment controls with clear feedback.

## Core Gameplay Loop
1. Choose a character.
2. Enter a floor of the tower.
3. Fight enemies, avoid hazards, and gather loot/resources.
4. Make build/progression choices.
5. Descend to deeper floors with increasing difficulty.
6. Repeat until defeat or run completion milestone.

## Modes and Scope
- Current planned release mode:
  - Single-player.
