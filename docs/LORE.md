# Gardens of Karaxas

## High Concept

Gardens of Karaxas is a top-down pixel art/stylized fantasy dungeon crawler.
The game is a real-time, fast paced hack and slash where the player takes control of an adventurer and climbs the endless tower of Karaxas - one of the pilars of creation, in search for power, relics, and riches.

Karaxas is vast and mysterious. Each floor is a unique world with its own challenges, secrets, and treasures... and enemies. Those who seek to devour any uninvited guests are many, though the guests themselves seldom find peaceful resolutions to conflicts involving magical artifacts or the occassional ritual.
