# Gardens of Karaxas - Game

## High Concept
Gardens of Karaxas is a top-down pixel art/stylized fantasy dungeon crawler.

The player selects one of many characters and climbs the endless Tower of Karaxas, one of the pillars of creation, searching for power, relics, and riches.

The game is real-time, not turn-based.

## Core Pillars
- Fast, readable real-time combat.
- Strong character identity and build expression.
- High replayability through floor progression and run variety.
- Atmospheric pixel/stylized fantasy presentation.
- Tight moment-to-moment controls with clear feedback.

## Core Gameplay Loop
1. Choose a character.
2. Enter a floor of the tower.
3. Fight enemies, avoid hazards, and gather loot/resources.
4. Make build/progression choices.
5. Descend to deeper floors with increasing difficulty.
6. Repeat until defeat or run completion milestone.

## Modes and Scope
- Current planned release mode:
  - Single-player.
- Future planned modes:
  - Co-op multiplayer (party progression through floors).
  - PvP mode (players compete for tower riches/rewards).

## Content Direction
- Character roster: multiple playable characters with distinct kits.
- Enemies and encounters: scaling by floor depth and biome/theme.
- Loot and progression: run-based and meta-progression details TBD.
- Bosses and events: milestone floors and special encounter logic TBD.

## Visual and Audio Direction
- Art style: top-down pixel art with stylized fantasy treatment.
- Readability first: combat telegraphs, hit feedback, and UI clarity over visual noise.
- Mood: mystical, dangerous, ancient tower atmosphere.

## Release Intent
- Windows distribution first.
- Linux and Steam distribution next.
- Android portability planned for later.

## Open Design Decisions
- Detailed combat stats and formulas.
- Character progression model (run-only vs run + meta).
- Itemization economy and rarity model.
- Co-op and PvP progression/reward boundaries.
- Narrative delivery and long-term world progression.
