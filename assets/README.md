Assets live here and should be organized as the project grows.

Suggested structure:
- `sprites/` - gameplay and environment sprites
- `fonts/` - bitmap or TTF fonts
- `shaders/` - GLSL shaders
- `ui/` - UI skins, nine-patches, and textures
- `audio/` - music, ambience, and SFX
- `data/` - gameplay/config data files

Keep large source files and export pipelines documented alongside final runtime assets.
